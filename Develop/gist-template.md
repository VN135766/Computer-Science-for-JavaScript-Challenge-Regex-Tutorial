# Computer Science for JavaScript Challenge: Regex Tutorial

So the purpose of this gist is to explain how a specific regex works and we will also go over how it works in general. 

## Summary

```
/^([a-z0-9_\.-]+)@([\da-z\.-]+)\.([a-z\.]{2,6})$/ 
```
Above in the code snippet, is the regex example that will be explained in this tutorial. This regex is specific to the pattern of an email.

## Regex Components
So basically the most common pattern of an email address is composed of 4 main groups, and they are:
- String of characters and/or digits and/or dots, hyphens and/or underscores
- The at sign (@)
- The domain name that can be a string of characters and/or digits
- The extension preceeded by a dot (.)

### Anchors
So basically anchors are used to contain the email expression. So looking at the example, we see that `^` is in the beginning, and `$` is at the end.
### Quantifiers
So my understanding is that the `+` character will match one or more of what we are searching for. So `[a-z0-9_\.-]+` means any characters of `[a-z0-9_\.-]` and more will be a matching record
### OR Operator
So the OR operator `|` or `[]` definition is any charaters specified between the opening and closing brackets will be matched. So in our email example, there are actually 3 times this occurs. 
So the first bracket expression is `[a-z0-9_\.-]` and what this means is that this includes case sensitive characters from a-z, numbers from 0-9, also an underscore, as well as periods and hyphens. The second bracket expression is`[\da-z\.-]`   and what this means is that it includes all digits `/d`, case sensitive characters from a-z, periods and hyphens. The last bracket expression is`[a-z\.]` and this one means that it includes case sensitive characters from a-z and periods.
### Character Classes
In the email example expression, the character class `/d` is used when we want to match any digit from 0 to 9.
### Flags
ok so my understandin is that flags affect the match result. There are 3 of them in this email example. 
```
i
With this flag the search is case-insensitive: no difference between A and a.

g
With this flag the search looks for all matches, without it â€“ only the first match is returned.

m
With this flag, when enabled (^) and ($) will match the start and end of a line instead of the whole string.
```
### Grouping and Capturing

### Bracket Expressions
So the bracket expression `[]` indicate a set of characters to match. 

### Greedy and Lazy Match

### Boundaries

### Back-references

### Look-ahead and Look-behind
